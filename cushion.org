*** PD's directions 
**** [2017-06-13 周二] Comments about samples off line trial on [2017-06-08 周四]
APAC Skincare PD preferred the 64-10 [fiber length-curl] for visual appearance ONLY after the surface was patted at least once with the puff applicator (aka "primed"). This allowed for the excess juice on the surface to be "blotted" and not sit on the surface of the sponge. As you will see from the attached photos, the surface of the sponge looks more even and uniform after priming. The same comment regarding visual appearance applies to the 51-10 MF option. The attached are photos of the 64-10 (primed and untouched) and 51-10 (primed and untouched) samples.
In addition, for each of the above 4 options there were 2 different sponge weights C Heavy and Light. The preference was the 64-10 'Heavy' because the degree of stiffness most closely matches the 0.04 MF samples GPD and APAC PD have seen in the past. The 51-10 'Heavy' is slightly yet noticeably softer in degree of stiffness vs. the 64-10 'Heavy' with fingertip evaluation. This difference is slightly less perceivable when evaluated with a puff applicator. Hence, we agreed with Jerry, Oswald and Jane that the next round of spec refinement for the sponge should aim to be within the range of 64-10 'Heavy' to 51-10 'Heavy'.
Lastly, regarding the height of the sponge, we already spoke to Jerry and Oswald that we'd like to increase the height slightly so the gap between the surface of the sponge and rim of the engine is lessened. We understand it's not advantageous to have the sponge too high/ touching the rim of the engine because there will be product contact with the seal which will impact aesthetics and possibly the adhesiveness of the seal. Per our discussion, this attribute will also be addressed in the next round of spec refinement.
**** Message to Hiroshi-san about PD's direction [2017-06-13 周二 13:19] \\
Regarding the gap:We've shared with Ida the experimental samples I made and we are aligned that we should leave a gap rather than have bulk on purity seal and risk to impact the adhesive of label. She need to further review with Jane for the maximum gap samples before share to US. For the trial happened in INOAC this week, we should target thickness of 9.7 or a little bit more to 9.8 if they can make a stable process as last time. Among that, we would like to pick up some samples near 10.2 to show the actual minimum gap, since we only have something > 9.8 last week.
Regarding stiffness of sponge: The most preferred option is 64-10, however the 51-10 and 51-15 are not bad, just because they are a little bit softer than the previously approved 0.04 samples. Since we recommended 51-10 from process standpoint and stiffness can be adjusted by weight, we'd like to keep 51-10 and adjust stiffness to be same as 64-10. The 25% CFD of 64-10 is 8.24 ~ 12.98 N (weight 0.61 ~ 0.78 g) while 51-10 is 7.21 ~ 12.69 (0.61 ~ 0.67 g). I believe it is possible to increase the 25% CFD of 51-10 to be same level of 64-10 by adding more fiber to an individual sponge which is increasing the density a little bit.
**** [2017-06-30 周五] PD's direction on samples of alternative material of PB0300M:PB0801M=7:3 by Ida_Wong. Base on hand filled samples. 
***** Surface appearance of the new sponge blend is actually quite good and even.
- Note taken on [2017-07-07 周五 17:38] \\
  The actual reason is hand fill. We cannot guarantee this with machine fill. I've clarified this with Jerry_Shen.
***** Compared to all the previously reviewed 0.04 sponges this "new" sub is softer (less rigid) when pressing with fingertips and when patting with puff applicator.
- Note taken on [2017-07-07 周五 17:39] \\
  Have Hiroshi_Hayashi to confirm with INOAC about the CFD of alternative material.
***** Since the sponge is softer than previous versions, there is noticeably more product (the juice) picked up with just one pat of the puff. Even after several uses there's a lot of juice being picked up on puff. We also see more than usual amounts of juice residing on the rim of the sponge [photos

  confirmed with Hellen, it's about 13g
lastly and most importantly, because we are getting more product on the sponge during pick up, it's requiring more pats on the face to fully blend into skin. Especially for fairer shades (like the NU Porcelain Pink), if you don't blend the product into skin it starts to look streaky/ blotchy.
Net-net: the sponge appearance is good, the softer "bounce" of the sponge is slightly different vs. previous but not necessarily a bad thing... however, the more than expected product pick and the amount of juice residing in the rim is not ideal. As you can see from the photos, the excess juice is spread towards the rim after patting with puff... the juice stays like that on the surface even after the compact has been "resting" and not in use. I wonder if there is a possibility for dry out since there's product sitting on the surface versus being soaked up in the sponge.

  From the email from David, it seems the Glow compact failed weight loss?
  
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I spoke to Allan and Tim on Friday.  It sounds like the 2 in 1 cushion failed weight loss, so the airtight engine will need to be re engineered to improve the weight loss results.  Because of this issue, I believe the timing has been moved out.
  As far as the pan insert, it does not look like either EL or Tom Ford have been contacting anybody to redesign it.

  1. R&D is recommending to seal the cushion only instead of cushion + glowing together, which will need to increase the partition wall between 2 bulk. And also need a unnormal shape of purity seal, which is very difficult to apply and high cost
  2. Bulk mark on purity seal on part of cushion, which can be solved by decrease the height of sponge.

  Meeting with Cammilla, Kelly Brice, Suguru Ishikawa...
  - In the mini blister, there is a gap between NBR puff and VF well. 
    Since the NBR sponge will swell with formula, they put too much allowance so that it's too small
  - AFR
    Dave Wilson has already talked with Camilla
  - La Mer PD still prefer NBR and they think this is more luxry than MF
  - Ask for more samples test the AFR of NBR
- Note taken on [2017-08-30 周三 10:45] \\

  Christine advise that NBR can absorb more than Micro-fiber after filling
  But Camilla advise that  the NBR samples received throughout this development have had the most bulk found on the back of the peal seal and on the frames. MF in comparison has a minimal amount of bulk on the back of the peal seal and with nothing on the frames.

:LOGBOOK:

  Allan Hafkin is taking care of the test with HCT. 
  It is confirmed that HCT has a proposal to eliminate the air vent and we have seen drawings but have yet to receive parts for testing. My best guess at this point is that we would be about 6 months out for implementation if indeed it does work. Allan Hafkin has been in discussions with HCT on this matter.

  According to Mark Schroeder (HCT’s patent counsel):  “[T]he product modification to remove the vent is going through qualification as I understand it.  Refinements were being made at last check on the mold cavities.  A next round of test results is expected in the next couple of days.”
  
  Mr. Schroeder also indicated that HCT is continuing to argue non-infringement as a defense to the allegations.
  
  I will keep you posted if I hear anything further on the legal end.

** Double side use puff
:LOGBOOK:

  Usage of myself
  1. The puff is too soft. It cause only the area around fingure can be press into sponge and get a good pickup.
  2. There is no waterproof membrance between 2 layers of rubycell. Bulk can transfer from front to back

  The Channel double side puff is a double side rubycell puff with PU in the middle
  It seems they can use both side, but actually it's hard to use both for hygiene issue
  And the puff is softe, too soft to press on the face

*** Material
- Daiwabo : Make fibers with PB-1 : PP = 1:1

- Evonik: Make 1-Buten
*** Material Supply Issue Mitigation
**** Communication
***** I've got a chance to talk with Basell HK (APAC),  they said back in March 2017, Basell has proposed Daiwabo to use alternative PB0300M to maintain same elasticity performance of DP0400M on fiber, what they need to do is to add additive to solve the yellowish problem.  Could you please get the confirmation from Daiwabo if they try and can use PB0300M to replace DP0400M?  Do we need to do another compatibility test etc?  Basell APAC said they plan to start production for DP0400M only in Sept (tentatively) and have no stock from their distributors.  They are checking if they got any stock from the lab but even they have, quantity will not be large.  Just see if Daiwabo can change resin but provide same quality standard to us.  Please help to check or have Daiwabo to get more details from Basell APAC. :@DorothyWong:
***** [2017-05-09 周二]: Evonik announced a force majeure to stop production of 1-Buten due to an explosion in the proximity of Evonik’s C4-plant at the Antwerp site on Sunday, May 7.
**** Alternative Proposal
***** Exiting: DP0400M
***** Alternative Proposed by Basell: PB0300M blend with PB0801M
Proposed by 2:1 to get MFI 15, but Daiwabo make a 7:3 blending for their own process. The theory MFI of 7:3 blending is 13.
***** Another Alternative Proposed by Daiwabo: BL4000 : PB0801M = 7:3
***** A test with NOX was done with proposed blending.
Mitsui 04000 + Basell 0800: The most yellow
Basell 0300 + Basell 0800: In the middle and close to Mitsui + Basell
The original one (Basell 0400 M) is the most white option.
***** Meeting with Basell about alternative resin
****** The MSDS calls out ‘contains additives and stabilizers’ (see first snapshot below).We need to know what the additives and stabilizers are in each of these materials (current and alternate blend) and its concentration, to confirm whether identical / equivalent.
******* Per Basell, even they are shown in different expressions, additives in all 3 resins are of the same kind of phenolic antioxidant with a level of approx. 500 ppm.
******* Sushil is asking : phenolic anti-oxidant for reference, and confirm that the concentration is the same?
****** Since the proposed version is a blend of PB0300M + PB0801M, we need to know the % (by weight) of each that will be blended to match the properties they expect to achieve that of the current DP0400M.
******* In theory, it could be 66.7% PB0300M + 33.3% PB0801M. But the optimized % need to be determined by Daiwabo with more trails.
******* Sushil is asking for  what the range of MFI would be expected of the blended materials
****** As per the TDS, the current material (DP0400M) has a melt flow rate of 15, while the alternative material blend, i.e., PB0300M with PB0801M, has a melt flow rate of 4 and 200, respectively. We need to know how such drastically different melt flow rate materials can be blended homogeneously, as well as, once blended, what is the resulting stability in its fiber making process (melt blown) and melt flow rate of the blend.
******* PB0300M and PB0801M have the same molecular structure with difference in molecular weight, so that they can be blend homogeneously. Molecular weight distribution of blending of PB0300M + PB0801M will be similar but a little bit wider than DP0400M, the difference is not so big to make unstable process. And even more, wider molecular weight distribution is better for fiber application per BASELL, that is the blending will have positive impact to fiber process.
******* The TDS of alternative materials additionally call out certain properties that are not noted in the current material description. PB0801M is noted as being used as a processing modifier (internal lubricant), and PB0300M forms a 2 phase structure for easier release. Can Lyondellbasell clarify if these characteristics can affect the non-woven converting, product wetting, absorption and release characteristics compared to the current DP0400M material?
******* Those are all call-outs for their designed applications. PB0801M is a low molecular weight PB-1 so that it was emphasized as processing modifier for its high MFI. All PB forms 2 phases (crystallized and amorphous) and PB0300M was emphasized for peelable film.

*** Specification
**** Deluxe Samples
Diameter: 32+/- 0.5 mm
Thickness: 9.7 +/- 0.5 mm
Density: 0.04 +/- 10% g/cm^3
Weight: Calculated: 0.258~ 0.372; Recommendation: 0.27 ~ 0.37 g (by ration to Saleable=.267~.356)
The above was calculated by same percentage of range as saleable.
**** Saleable
Diameter: 48 +/- 0.5 mm
Thickness: 9.7 +/- 0.5 mm
Density: 0.04 +/- 10% g/cm^3
Weight: Calculated: 0.587 ~ 0.829; Recommendation: 0.6 ~ 0.8 g
PD’s approval last time was basing on hand feeling, which we can get the 25% CFD from same batch as 8.24 ~ 12.98 N. But in that batch of CFD test, weight range is only 0.61 ~ 0.78 g, while the worst case calculate with 9.7 +/- 0.5 is 0.587 ~ 0.829 g. We think we need to tighten the range, since 0.587 ~ 0.829 cannot guarantee a density variation of +/- 10%.
So I’m thinking if we can have a negotiation with INOAC to set a range between 0.622 ~ 0.796 (convert from 0.61 ~ 0.78 of 9.5mmt to 9.7mmt) and 0.578 ~ 0.829. How do you think about 0.6 ~ 0.8g? From your data for latest run, it will be 96%+ yield rate with this specification. Pls let me know your thoughts about that. Thanks!

- Micro Fiber
  - Status of Line Trials. (When and the purpose)
    - When is the new equipment arriving at Inoac? (Do we need to qualify?)
    - Latest samples showed a “saturated carpet” look. This was not reported in previous trials. Has something changed? Can this be eliminated by changing filling parameters?
    - There is a thought that we may be being too critical on what we are requiring from an aesthetic standpoint.  Compared to original PU standards, how do these look? I know we have ranges so we need to determine if these are acceptable for launch with the agreement for continuous improvement. How do we accomplish this?
  - It has been suggested that we have Inoac do a 100% inspection and they have quoted at nearly 4 times the original quote. We cannot live with this. How do we eliminate this inspection but still ensure acceptable parts?
- PU Sponge- The same question on being too critical applies here. There is pushback on the smoothing process and the $.017 charge.
- How do non-wiped samples look? Are they comparable to original standards?
- How do we identify ranges for Brands/Product Development review and approval?
- How long before we can automate?

*** Kolmar signed a contract with Amore Pacific to pay loyalty fee :@Kolmar:
Kolmar is using both ester and ether PU. And these are common sponges used in the Korea market. However so far they have not used NBR. And besides, They do not have their own sponge options. - @DocHwan
1. Kolmar has signed off contract with Amore regarding cushion production. 
2. Contract is mainly to use Amore patented 100% ether based PU sponge. In this case, Kolmar pays 3% vs. Amore cushion retail price per single sponge as loyalty. 
3. Contract doesn’t include any term which specify Kolmar should not produce/deliver any cushion to the clients like Estee Lauder, Chanel, L’Oreal, LVMH etc. 
4. Amore is aware that Kolmar is producing BB cushion to Estee Lauder. And Amore didn’t consider this as breach of a contract as this is not contracted term. Also this isn’t an issue from business relationship point of view
5. It is considered that Kolmar can produce ELC cushion without any legal issue.

*** Specification:
**** Density: 130, 180, 240 g/m^2
180g was commonly used in Taiki's factory and have a very low MOQ (about tens of thousands). 240g is not commonly used and there is a MOQ of 280K.
We tried 180g at the early stage and there is a delamination issue. After that we asked for 240g samples. It looks better, but need further test.
