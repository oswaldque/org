***** Potential root cause
- Insides of caps were swabbed with isopropyl alcohol and some improvement was noticed. That means there is something on inside surface of the cap?
- Get other lots of samples from a TPM and those caps perform much better than this lot. 
- If we're above 5 in-lbs for immediate removal torque, that's generally OK. Some batches were OK, but QA was measuring immediate removal torques of less than 4 in-lbs with the same batch of MDPE bottles, but different batches of caps. Torque report from 5 different batches from KKP was shown.

  Shannon Steven answered as below
  
  Ronan,
  
  I called Jeff Bullins today to clarify the questions you had.
  
  When they first sampled the tool they ran it in a smaller press and were only able to run 16 cavities and also culled through the samples so you probably got a better picture.
  
  The second sample was to show the flash issue was fixed and the dimensions were in spec. It was run in a different press that could run all 24 cavities but did not run the tool long enough to tweak the process completely as they needed to pull the tool to set up for the next tool production run.
  
  The new 15ml tool has improved cooling around the gate area with an addition of a gate insert (first shot only). We are trying to propose the second shot gate insert to EL now but they will need to approve the esthetics of the witness line on the bottom of the jar. This would help the cold slug and splay issue but will need to work on this. 
  
  We are also making tweaks to the venting system as they are not adequate and causing issues. All the tools have the same issues and all the changes will need to be made to all the tools.
  
  The parts are being culled at the press for all the defects and also being culled again after decoration to insure the EL gets good parts. Technimark has a very high scrap rate on these jars and needs to work on the mold issues, right now they are eating the scrap costs.

A policy change from animal fiber brush to synthetic brush, only drawing approval is needed.
Here is the spreadsheet of all the brush codes, PD approval status, and package testing status as we discussed in our meeting. We will be sending you drawings of brushes that have been approved by PD and also the package testing lab. Most drawings are just a material change from natural to synthetic hair, and a few have increased the brush fibers to help with the pay off of the synthetic fibers. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you again for your support we truly appreciate it!
